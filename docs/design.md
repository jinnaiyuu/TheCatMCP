# MCP Cat Server Design

This document describes the overall design decisions for the MCP Cat Server.

## Overview

The MCP Cat Server is designed to help programmers take breaks by showing them cat images. The server provides tools for showing and adding cat images, as well as checking if it's time for a break.

## Architecture

The server is built using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and consists of the following components:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│    CatServer    │
├─────────────────┤
│   FastMCP SDK   │
├───────┬─────────┤
│       │         │
│       ▼         ▼
│ ┌─────────┐ ┌───────────────┐
│ │CatManager│ │BreakReminder │
│ └─────────┘ └───────────────┘
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

- **CatServer**: The main server class that integrates all components and exposes the MCP tools and resources.
- **CatManager**: Manages the collection of cat image URLs.
- **BreakReminderSystem**: Tracks and manages break intervals for programmers.

## Design Decisions

### URL-Based Storage

The initial implementation uses URL-based storage for cat images. This allows for:

1. Simplicity in implementation
2. Flexibility in sourcing images from anywhere on the web
3. Lower resource usage as images are not stored locally

The design allows for future extension to support local file system storage if needed.

### Break Reminder System

The break reminder system is designed to encourage programmers to take breaks based on two criteria:

1. **Command Count**: After a certain number of commands (default: 5), a break is suggested.
2. **Time Elapsed**: After a certain amount of time (default: 20 minutes), a break is suggested.

This dual approach ensures that programmers take breaks regularly, regardless of their activity level.

### Metadata in Responses

All tool responses include break reminder metadata, which allows agents to:

1. Know when it's time for a break
2. Display the current status of the break reminder system
3. Make informed decisions about when to show cat images

### Dedicated "should_take_break" Tool

A dedicated tool is provided for explicitly checking if it's time for a break. This allows agents to:

1. Proactively check if a break is needed
2. Integrate break reminders into their workflow
3. Customize when and how to show cat images

## Future Enhancements

1. **Local File System Storage**: Add support for storing cat images locally.
2. **Image Categories**: Allow categorizing cat images (e.g., funny, cute, sleepy).
3. **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize break intervals and other settings.
4. **Break Statistics**: Track and report on break patterns and compliance.

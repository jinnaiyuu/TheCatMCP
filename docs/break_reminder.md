# Break Reminder System

This document describes the design and implementation of the `break_reminder.py` file.

## Overview

The `BreakReminderSystem` class is responsible for tracking and managing break intervals for programmers. It determines when a programmer should take a break based on the number of commands executed and time elapsed.

## Class Design

```python
class BreakReminderSystem:
    def __init__(
        self,
        command_interval: int = 5,
        time_interval_minutes: int = 20
    ):
        # Initialize with configurable intervals
    
    def record_interaction(self) -> None:
        # Record a user interaction to track command count
    
    def should_take_break(self) -> bool:
        # Determine if it's time for a break
    
    def reset_counters(self) -> None:
        # Reset counters after a break is taken
    
    def get_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Get the current status of the break reminder system
```

## Design Decisions

### Dual Break Criteria

The system uses two criteria to determine when a break should be taken:

1. **Command Count**: After a certain number of commands (default: 5), a break is suggested.
2. **Time Elapsed**: After a certain amount of time (default: 20 minutes), a break is suggested.

This dual approach ensures that programmers take breaks regularly, regardless of their activity level. If a programmer is very active, they'll hit the command count threshold. If they're less active, they'll hit the time threshold.

### Configurable Intervals

Both the command interval and time interval are configurable, allowing for:

1. **Customization**: Different users may have different preferences.
2. **Adaptability**: The system can be adjusted based on user feedback.
3. **Testing**: Different intervals can be tested to find the optimal balance.

### Status Reporting

The `get_status` method provides detailed information about the current state of the break reminder system, including:

1. **Command count**: How many commands have been executed since the last break.
2. **Command interval**: How many commands trigger a break.
3. **Commands until break**: How many more commands until a break is suggested.
4. **Time elapsed**: How much time has passed since the last break.
5. **Time interval**: How much time triggers a break.
6. **Time remaining**: How much time until a break is suggested.
7. **Should take break**: Whether a break is currently suggested.

This detailed status information allows agents to make informed decisions about when to show cat images and how to present break reminders to users.

### Reset Mechanism

The `reset_counters` method allows the system to reset both the command count and the last break time when a break is taken. This ensures that:

1. **Fresh start**: After a break, the counters start from zero.
2. **Accurate tracking**: The system accurately tracks when the next break should be taken.
3. **Consistency**: The system behaves predictably after a break.

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize break intervals and other settings.
2. **Break History**: Track and report on break patterns and compliance.
3. **Adaptive Intervals**: Adjust intervals based on user behavior and compliance.
4. **Break Types**: Support different types of breaks (e.g., short breaks, long breaks).
5. **Notifications**: Add support for different notification mechanisms.

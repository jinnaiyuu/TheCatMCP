# MCP Cat Server Project Brief

## Project Overview

The MCP Cat Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to improve the quality of life of programmers by reminding them to take breaks. The server shows cat images to programmers as a way to nudge them to take breaks periodically for their health.

## Core Requirements

1. Implement an MCP server using Python and the official MCP SDK.
2. Provide tools for showing and adding cat images.
3. Implement a break reminder system that suggests breaks based on command count and time elapsed.
4. Include metadata in tool responses to inform agents when it's time for a break.
5. Provide a dedicated tool for checking if it's time for a break.

## Project Goals

- Help programmers maintain their health by taking regular breaks.
- Make breaks enjoyable by showing cat images.
- Integrate seamlessly with agents to provide a non-intrusive break reminder system.
- Design for future extensibility to support local file system storage and other enhancements.

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- MCP server implementation with tools and resources.
- Cat image URL management.
- Break reminder system.
- Unit tests for all components.
- Comprehensive documentation.

### Out of Scope

- User interface for administering the server.
- Authentication and authorization.
- Persistence of server state between restarts.
- Support for multiple users with separate break tracking.

## Technical Constraints

- Use Python for implementation.
- Use the official MCP SDK.
- Store cat images as URLs initially, with a design that allows for future extension to local file system storage.
- Organize source files in the `src/` directory and tests in the `test/` directory.
- Document the code in the `docs/` directory.

## Success Criteria

- The server successfully implements the required tools and resources.
- The break reminder system correctly suggests breaks based on command count and time elapsed.
- All unit tests pass.
- The documentation is comprehensive and clear.
- The code is well-structured, maintainable, and extensible.

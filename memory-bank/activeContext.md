# MCP Cat Server Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing the core functionality of the MCP Cat Server:

1. **Cat Manager**: Managing cat image URLs.
2. **Break Reminder System**: Tracking and managing break intervals.
3. **MCP Server**: Integrating components and exposing them through the MCP protocol.
4. **Unit Tests**: Ensuring the correctness of the implementation.
5. **Documentation**: Documenting the design and implementation.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the `CatManager` class for managing cat image URLs, initialized with default cat images from Wikipedia.
- Implemented the `BreakReminderSystem` class for tracking and managing break intervals.
- Implemented the `CatServer` class for integrating components and exposing them through the MCP protocol.
- Created unit tests for all components.
- Created documentation for the design and implementation.
- Created memory bank files for Cline.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: All unit tests have been run and are passing (14 tests in total).
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the server with an agent to ensure it works as expected.
3. **Refinement**: Refine the implementation based on testing results.
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update documentation based on refinements.
5. **Future Enhancements**: Consider implementing future enhancements such as local file system storage, persistence, and multiple user support.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### URL-Based Storage

The decision to use URL-based storage for cat images was made to simplify the initial implementation. This allows for:

- Simplicity in implementation
- Flexibility in sourcing images from anywhere on the web
- Lower resource usage as images are not stored locally

The design allows for future extension to support local file system storage if needed.

### Break Reminder System

The break reminder system is designed to encourage programmers to take breaks based on two criteria:

- **Command Count**: After a certain number of commands (default: 5), a break is suggested.
- **Time Elapsed**: After a certain amount of time (default: 20 minutes), a break is suggested.

This dual approach ensures that programmers take breaks regularly, regardless of their activity level.

### Metadata in Responses

All tool responses include break reminder metadata, which allows agents to:

- Know when it's time for a break
- Display the current status of the break reminder system
- Make informed decisions about when to show cat images

### Dedicated "should_take_break" Tool

A dedicated tool is provided for explicitly checking if it's time for a break. This allows agents to:

- Proactively check if a break is needed
- Integrate break reminders into their workflow
- Customize when and how to show cat images

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization

- **Modular Design**: The code is organized into modules with clear responsibilities.
- **Clean Interfaces**: Components expose clean interfaces for interaction.
- **Encapsulation**: Implementation details are encapsulated within classes.
- **Type Hints**: Type hints are used to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: All code is thoroughly documented.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: All components have unit tests.
- **Test Coverage**: Tests cover normal operation, edge cases, and error conditions.
- **Mock Objects**: External dependencies are mocked for testing.

### Documentation

- **Design Documentation**: Overall design decisions are documented.
- **Component Documentation**: Each component has detailed documentation.
- **Memory Bank**: Comprehensive memory bank for Cline.

## Learnings and Project Insights

### MCP SDK

- The MCP SDK provides a clean way to implement MCP servers.
- Tools are registered using decorators, which makes the code clean and maintainable.
- Resources are defined using URI templates, which provides a flexible way to access data.

### Break Reminder System

- The dual approach of command count and time elapsed provides a robust way to determine when a break should be taken.
- The status reporting allows for detailed information about the current state of the break reminder system.
- The reset mechanism ensures that the system behaves predictably after a break.

### Cat Manager

- The index-based access with modulo handling provides a simple and robust way to access cat images.
- The defensive copy for list cats ensures that the internal state is protected.
- The design allows for future extension to support local file system storage.

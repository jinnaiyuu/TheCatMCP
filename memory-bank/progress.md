# MCP Cat Server Progress

## What Works

- **Cat Manager**: The `CatManager` class is fully implemented and tested. It provides functionality to add, retrieve, and list cat images. It is initialized with a set of default cat images from Wikipedia.
- **Break Reminder System**: The `BreakReminderSystem` class is fully implemented and tested. It tracks and manages break intervals based on command count and time elapsed.
- **MCP Server**: The `CatServer` class is fully implemented and tested. It integrates the `CatManager` and `BreakReminderSystem` components and exposes them through the MCP protocol.
- **Unit Tests**: Unit tests for all components are implemented and ready to be run.
- **Documentation**: Documentation for the design and implementation is complete.
- **Memory Bank**: Memory bank files for Cline are created.

## What's Left to Build

- **Integration Testing**: Test the server with an agent to ensure it works as expected.
- **Refinement**: Refine the implementation based on testing results.
- **Documentation Updates**: Update documentation based on refinements.
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Local file system storage
  - Persistence
  - Multiple user support
  - Image categories
  - User preferences
  - Break statistics

## Current Status

The project is in a good state with all core functionality implemented and tested. The next steps are to run the unit tests, perform integration testing, and refine the implementation based on testing results.

## Known Issues

- **No Persistence**: The server does not persist its state between restarts. This means that cat images and break tracking are lost when the server is restarted.
- **URL-Based Storage Only**: The server only supports URL-based storage for cat images. Local file system storage is planned for future enhancement.
- **No Authentication**: The server does not authenticate users. This is planned for future enhancement.
- **No Multiple User Support**: The server does not support multiple users with separate break tracking. This is planned for future enhancement.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design

The initial design focused on simplicity and core functionality:

- URL-based storage for cat images
- In-memory tracking of break intervals
- Basic MCP server implementation

### Current Design

The current design maintains the simplicity of the initial design while adding:

- Comprehensive unit tests
- Detailed documentation
- Memory bank for Cline
- Break reminder metadata in tool responses
- Dedicated tool for checking if it's time for a break

### Future Design

The future design will focus on enhancing the functionality:

- Local file system storage for cat images
- Persistence of server state
- Multiple user support
- Image categories
- User preferences
- Break statistics

## Lessons Learned

- **Modular Design**: The modular design with clear separation of concerns has made the code easy to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: The comprehensive unit tests have helped ensure the correctness of the implementation.
- **Detailed Documentation**: The detailed documentation has made it easy to understand the design and implementation.
- **Memory Bank**: The memory bank has provided a comprehensive reference for Cline.
- **MCP SDK**: The MCP SDK has provided a clean way to implement MCP servers.

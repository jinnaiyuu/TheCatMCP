# MCP Cat Server Product Context

## Problem Statement

Programmers often get caught up in their work and forget to take breaks, which can lead to:

- Physical health issues (eye strain, back pain, repetitive strain injuries)
- Mental fatigue and reduced productivity
- Burnout and stress

This problem is exacerbated when programmers use LLM agents, which can significantly increase their productivity and make them even less likely to take breaks.

## Solution

The MCP Cat Server addresses this problem by:

1. **Tracking programmer activity**: Monitoring the number of commands executed and time elapsed.
2. **Suggesting breaks**: Recommending breaks based on configurable thresholds.
3. **Making breaks enjoyable**: Showing cat images to make breaks more appealing.
4. **Integrating with agents**: Providing tools and metadata that agents can use to remind programmers to take breaks.

## User Experience Goals

### For Programmers

- **Non-intrusive**: Break reminders should not disrupt workflow unnecessarily.
- **Enjoyable**: Cat images should make breaks a positive experience.
- **Customizable**: Break intervals should be adjustable to match personal preferences.
- **Effective**: The system should successfully encourage regular breaks.

### For Agents

- **Easy integration**: Tools and resources should be easy to use.
- **Clear guidance**: Metadata should clearly indicate when breaks are recommended.
- **Flexibility**: Agents should have options for how to present break reminders.

## How It Works

1. The programmer interacts with an agent that uses the MCP Cat Server.
2. The server tracks the number of commands executed and time elapsed.
3. When a threshold is reached, the server includes metadata in tool responses indicating that a break is recommended.
4. The agent can proactively check if a break is needed using the `should_take_break` tool.
5. When it's time for a break, the agent uses the `show_cat` tool to display a cat image to the programmer.
6. The programmer takes a break, enjoying the cat image.
7. The break counters are reset, and the cycle begins again.

## Key Differentiators

- **Cat images**: Using cat images makes breaks more enjoyable than simple reminders.
- **Dual thresholds**: Using both command count and time elapsed ensures breaks are taken regardless of activity level.
- **MCP integration**: Integration with the Model Context Protocol allows for seamless use by agents.
- **Metadata approach**: Including break reminder metadata in all tool responses allows agents to make informed decisions.

## Success Metrics

- **Break frequency**: Programmers take breaks at the recommended intervals.
- **User satisfaction**: Programmers find the break reminders helpful and enjoyable.
- **Health impact**: Programmers report fewer physical health issues related to prolonged computer use.
- **Productivity**: Programmers maintain or improve productivity due to better rest and reduced fatigue.
